Portfolio Analytics Engine (Python + PM Domain)
This project replicates the core analytics used in portfolio construction and front-office decision-making.
Using a sample multi-asset portfolio, I built an end-to-end exposure analysis engine in Python, applying real workflows used by PMs and risk teams.
What’s included
•	Asset-class exposure
•	Sector and industry breakdowns
•	Issuer-level aggregation (multi-asset)
•	Weighted average duration for fixed income
•	Top & bottom position contributors
•	Rating exposure
•	Drill-down analytics for flexible slicing (issuer/sector/asset class)
Even though the dataset is a mock sample, the analytics mirror the exact questions PMs ask when sizing positions, validating risk budgets, or aligning duration targets.
